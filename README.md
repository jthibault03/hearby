## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.0 or later
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Spotify Developer Account (for API credentials)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jthibault03/hearby.git
cd hearby/web-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Spotify Credentials

1. Create a Spotify Developer account at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com)
2. Create a new app in your Spotify Developer Dashboard
3. Add `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback'` to your Redirect URIs (for development)
4. Update `src/services/SpotifyManager.js` with your credentials:

```javascript
this.clientId = 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID';
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. **First Launch**: Tap "Connect with Spotify" to authenticate
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow location access when prompted by your browser
3. **Explore**: View the map showing your location and nearby listeners
4. **Discover**: Tap on map markers to see what others are listening to
5. **Share**: Your currently playing track is displayed at the bottom

## Mobile Optimization

The app is designed with a mobile-first approach:

- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to any screen size
- **Touch Controls**: Optimized for touch interactions
- **Mobile Viewport**: Proper viewport meta tags
- **PWA Support**: Can be installed as a Progressive Web App
- **Safe Areas**: Supports notched devices
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size

## Development

### Mock Data

The current implementation includes mock data for demonstration:
- Mock Spotify authentication flow
- Sample nearby listeners
- Example tracks

For production, you'll need to:
1. Implement actual Spotify API calls
2. Set up a backend service for user discovery
3. Implement real-time data synchronization

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real Spotify SDK integration
- [ ] Backend service for user discovery
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket updates
- [ ] Friend system
- [ ] Music recommendations based on nearby listeners
- [ ] Social features (like, comment, share)
- [ ] Privacy controls (invisible mode, radius control)
- [ ] Push notifications

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Modern UI framework
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive maps with OpenStreetMap
- **JavaScript/ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features
- **CSS3**: Responsive mobile-first design
- **Browser APIs**: Geolocation, LocalStorage
- **Spotify Web API**: Music playback data (OAuth 2.0 + PKCE)

## Security & Privacy

- Location data is only used for displaying on the map
- Spotify authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (no client secret)
- No personal data is stored permanently
- Users can disconnect at any time
- HTTPS required for production (geolocation requirement)

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Safari 14+ (including Mobile Safari)
