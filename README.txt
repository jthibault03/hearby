How to build and run project:

Our project consists only of a frontend application, and does not need any environment variables to fully function.

1. Application files are located in the "web-app" directory. `cd` into the "web-app" directory.
```
cd web-app
```

2. Install the dependencies through npm.
```
npm install
```

3. Run the dev server.
```
npm run start
```
